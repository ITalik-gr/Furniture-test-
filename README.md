<p>
  The site was developed as a test task. 
  </br>
  There are 2 sliders on the site, the first one is made without js libraries, the second one is made using the Swiper library. </br>
  In product categories, tabs work in JS through date attributes. All products are generated from a data array automatically (as if the data comes from a server).
